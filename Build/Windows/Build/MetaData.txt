- Gameplay Integration: Fragility drives the ghost creation mechanic - vulnerability becomes strength
- Strategic Element: Players must carefully plan routes knowing each mistake creates a helpful ghost

GAME DESCRIPTION
================
Ghost of Luna is a 2D platformer where death becomes your greatest ally. Players navigate challenging levels filled with spikes, bombs, and platforming puzzles. When you die, a semi-transparent ghost spawns that perfectly replays your previous attempt's movements. These ghosts are solid and can be jumped on, creating stepping stones to reach previously inaccessible areas.

The game transforms the traditional concept of "failure" into a core puzzle-solving mechanic. Your fragility isn't a weaknessâ€”it's a tool. Each death provides valuable information and a new platform for your next attempt.
